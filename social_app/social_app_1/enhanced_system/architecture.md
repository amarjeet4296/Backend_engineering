# Enhanced Social Security Application System Architecture

## System Overview

The enhanced system uses a multi-agent architecture orchestrated through LangGraph to automate the application process for social security benefits. The system can process applications in minutes rather than days with high accuracy and consistency.

## Components

### 1. Data Ingestion Layer
- **Multimodal Document Processor**
  - Processes text (forms, reports)
  - Extracts data from images (IDs, scanned documents)
  - Handles tabular data (financial statements, Excel files)
- **Form Interface**
  - Interactive web form for direct application input
  - Real-time validation and guidance

### 2. Data Storage Layer
- **PostgreSQL Database**
  - Stores structured application data
  - Maintains audit trails and processing history
- **ChromaDB Vector Database**
  - Stores embeddings of policy documents
  - Enables semantic search for regulations and guidelines

### 3. Agent Layer
- **Orchestrator Agent**
  - Coordinates workflow between specialized agents
  - Makes high-level decisions about application routing
- **Data Collection Agent**
  - Enhanced OCR capabilities
  - Multi-document correlation
  - Information extraction from various document types
- **Validation Agent**
  - Rules-based data validation
  - Consistency checking across documents
  - Anomaly detection
- **Assessment Agent**
  - Eligibility determination
  - Risk assessment and scoring
  - Decision recommendations
- **Counselor Agent**
  - Personalized guidance
  - Policy explanation
  - Support recommendation

### 4. Machine Learning Layer
- **Classifier Models**
  - Application risk classification
  - Fraud detection
  - Priority determination
- **Recommendation System**
  - Economic enablement recommendations
  - Training and upskilling suggestions
  - Job matching

### 5. User Interface Layer
- **Interactive Dashboard**
  - Application status tracking
  - Document upload and management
  - Decision visualization
- **Chatbot Interface**
  - Real-time assistance
  - Application guidance
  - Policy clarification

### 6. Observability Layer
- **Monitoring System**
  - Performance metrics
  - Agent behavior tracking
  - Error detection and reporting
- **Audit System**
  - Decision explanation
  - Process transparency
  - Compliance verification

## Data Flow

1. User submits application through web form or uploads documents
2. Orchestrator agent routes documents to data collection agent
3. Data collection agent extracts and structures information
4. Validation agent verifies data completeness and consistency
5. Assessment agent evaluates eligibility and risk
6. Counselor agent provides recommendations and guidance
7. Results presented to user through dashboard and chatbot
8. All interactions and decisions logged for audit and improvement
